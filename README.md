# Learn React by Official Tutorial

This is a repo doing the [React official tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html) step by step.

The first several commits are about setting up the whole developing environment. It is not within the official tutorial.
You can refer to [this](http://jasmineyuan.com/2017/03/06/Set-Up-React-Env/) for detailed explanation.

The last several commits are about the wrapping up parts of the tutorial:
1. Display the move locations in the format "(1, 3)" instead of "6".
2. Bold the currently-selected item in the move list.
3. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
4. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
5. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
