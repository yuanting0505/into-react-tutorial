#Learn React by Official Tutorial

This is a repo doing the [React official tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html) step by step.

The first several commits are about setting up the whole developing environment. It is not within the official tutorial.
You can refer to [this](http://jasmineyuan.com/2017/03/06/Set-Up-React-Env/) for detailed explanation.
